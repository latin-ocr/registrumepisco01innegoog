lxxviii THE PREFAOE.

The statutas of the Chapter, during the vacancyof the See, aiter
the death of Bishop Heury Lychtou,¹ are an example of the efforts
made by the Oanons to secure their independence, which they

lation of the members of the choir.²

No part of the collection vvill be regarded with greater interest
by the Church antiquary‚ than the directions for the ritual of the
cheir, which, thou'gh not dated, may, without much hesitation, from
their position, bc ascribed to the pontificata of Bishop ingelram.³

Sacristan,⁶ accidentally affords us the most lively representation

the laws and customs of auy Scotch cathedral.

The short ‘memoria’ giving the Church tradition concerning
the foundation and translation oi the Episcopal See,⁷ has evidently
been engressed in the Rapistrum Album, in the time of Bishop
