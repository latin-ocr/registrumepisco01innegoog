THE PREFACE.

Wnrnrr we exercite a wholesome scepticism in testing the
legendary miracles to which a simple people are apt to ascribe
their conversion to a new religion, there is some danger in Scot-
landos losingaight oi the main fact of the conversion oi the
Nation from heathenisnr to Christianity. Let it not be forgotten,
that at a period anterior to record or chronicle, the tribes of
various origin and lauguage who then inhabited Scotland, were
all brought from paganism within the pale of the Christian church.
The meana of their conversion are not even alluded to hythe civil
historiam but some traces of them may be found, faint indeed,
and disligured by credulity, in the old traditione of the Church,
and in the rude memoriale which the piety of their followere has
left us, of the lives and actions of the apostles of the truth in
Scotland. In rejecting, where separable, the fabulous portion
of such materiale, we must ever remember that there can be nothing
iu the most marvellous of legenda more incredible than that the
couversion of a Nation to Christianity should have been effected

without any human ageney.
