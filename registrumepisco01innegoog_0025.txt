The references in this table are all to charters recorded in this re-
gister which have been already described. They are only mentioned
at present to show, that the writer of the record, although he mis-
takes the fatherof Malcolm ΙΙΙ., whom he calls Kenneth instead of
Duncan, is, in other respecta, consistent with himself, end with the
ascertained chronology. He ascribes the marriage of Malcolm and
Margaret to the year 1070, which is the date assigned by the Chro-
niole of Melros¹ to the nuptiale of Malcolm Canmor and Margaret
