x THE PREFACE.

An ancient life of Saint Columba informs us, that one of his
Irish disciples, named Machar, received Episcopal ordination, and
undertook to preach the Gospel in the northern parts of the
Pictish kingdom. The legend adds, that Columba admonished
him to found his church, when he should arrivs upon the bank
of a river, where it formed, by its windings‚ the figure of a Bishop's
l crosier. Obeying the injunctions of his master, Machar advanced
northwards, preaching Christianity, until he found, at the mouth
of the Don, the situation indicated by Saint Columba, and finally
settled there his Christian colony, and founded the church which,
from its situation, was called the Church of Aberdon.¹ The life
of the apostle of the Scots from which we derive this information,
of much higher antiquity than any history of civil affairs in Scot-
land, does not give the precise era of Saint Machar’s foundation3
but it may be conjectured to have been before the death of his
master, which took place in the year 597. 'l'he venerable Breviary
of Aberdeen gives, as the ancient tradition of the church, that the
founder of the future cathedral was not interred there; but, hav-
ing died in France on his return from a journey to Rome, he was
buried in the church of Saint Martin of Tours.

Another adventurous band of missionaries of the same stock
pushed still farther into the pagan fastnesses of the north, and
established their little Christian family in the sequestered valley
of the Fiddich, at Morthlac . Their colony must have thriven in
the benevolence of the people, since, in the beginning of the
twelfth century, the “ Monastery of Morthlach '’ was possessed of
lire churches with their territories.
