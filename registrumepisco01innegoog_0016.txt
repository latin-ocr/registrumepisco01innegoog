admitted, that neither it, nor the following charter of David,¹ nor
the three which profess to be of Melcolm Iv.,² cau be sustained
as genuine, if their recorder set them down se perfect transcripte
of the originale. It may not be altogether unreasonable to regard
certain of these entries rather iu the light of memorandums of
actual gronts, to which the scribe had stupidly affired the conclu·
sion and mode of testing aud dating, that were in foshiou in the
charters of his own time. With regsrd to some of them, it is
difficult ιο divine any object for which such writs could be forged.
Others, however, contoin subjecte of great velue to the church, and

' ancient as grantsof David and his grandson. But even if some

memoriale and put into aformal legal shape to serve a law pur·
pose, or as true entries tempered with by an ignorant copyist, itis
unsefe for an enquirer into the History of the Diooese to draw
facts or dates from any of them.³

ancient cherters, does not, on the whole, sid
the presumption of its suthenticlty. lt must
strilre sny one, however, who has psid any
attention to Seoteh eureis, thst the style of
this charter is compsntively modern. The
