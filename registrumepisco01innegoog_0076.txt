lxviii THE PREFACE.

contente, aa well as the notes to this Preface by certain letters, -
under which they may now be described.

A.

vhe larger of the two volumes of Aberdeen Regimen which are
preserved in the Advocates’ Library, seems to have been anciently
called the “ Registrum Album.”¹ lt consiste of 188 numbered
leaves of vellum, written in many different hands, and at very
different periods; but no part of it can be safely ascribed toan
earlier date than the middle of the foarteenth century. Its ar·
rangement is unmethodical. The part which has originally formed
the beginning of the record, consiste of bullsand charters in favour
of the Knights Templars aad Hospitallers, which are followed by
the charter containing the constitution of the cathedral as fixpd in
1256, a few ancient charters, and the well known “ StatutaGener-
alia ‘Ecclesie Scoticanelf

In abund, nearly of the same period, follows a list of bishops, and
a few ancient charters, some of which are of questionable autho·
rity; and the margins are disligured with clumsy attempta to fix
their dates.

A miscellaneous collection of charters and instrumenta follows;
and the curicus rental of Alexander ΙΙΙ., by which the second
tithes of the bishop were collected, with lists of taxatione of bene-
ficas, conclude the older section of the volume, consisting of 104
laevae, in which, however, there are many interpolatione. From
folio 105 to 128, consiste of charters written about the beginning
of the fifteenth century, and with these probably ended theold
‘⁶ Registrum Album.'’ The subsequent leaves are of amore modern
handwriting‚ and of inferior vellum.
