THE PREFACE. xi

It was the fate of the ancient Columbite foundations in Scot-
laud to fall before the reforming vehemence of David 1, the most
aealous of Romanists3 who raised on the ruins of many a Culdec
monastery, his magnificent establishmeuts of Augustinian canons
or Benedictines, or engrafted on their convente, the chapters of
his new Episcopal dioceses. In this manner, the bishoprick of
Aberdeen was founded by David, and endowed with several of the
old Ouldee possessione, among others, with the “Monastery of
Morthlaclr,'’ aud its five churchea.

The circumstantial account given by Forduu and Boece of tho
foundation of a bishop's See at Morthlach by Malcolm ΙΙ. iu
1010, must not be passed over. eratever may be thought of the
greater historieal work of Boece, it is certain that he framed his
history of the Bishops of the See of Morthlach aud Aherdeen,
from no other or fuller materials than those that have come
down to us ;1 and this part of it rests upon certain charters
which he quotes; upou a tradition of the church, which may
be traced in its registcrs and its service books; and, lastly‚ upon
the authority of Fordun, who wrote about the end of the four-
teenth century.

It is necessary to clear the way, by disposing of five charters
found in the oldest extant register of Aberdeen,² which would
have been very important for settling this question, if they
could be relied upon as genuine. Unfortunately, it is not so.
The first charter printed in the following sheets, which was
certainly meant to pass for one of Malcolm Canmor, has been
very generally denounced as a palpable forgery; and it must be
