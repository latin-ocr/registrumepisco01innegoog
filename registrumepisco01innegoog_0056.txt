xlviii ΤΗΕ PREFACE.

in writing the history of his notiori, and gothered in ons volume
all the antiquitics that could be found thereof. The memories
also of those holy men who lived in former times in this kingdom,
he studied to preserve, committing to writing their wortby and
memorable acts, and giving order that on solemn days the religious
should read some part thereos in their common meetings. N ever
was he seen to bs idle, but always in labour and striving how to
benefit the public. Nor was there any man known to have been
of more integrity of life and manners, sweet and pleasant conver·
sation, of a cheerful countenance, and exceeding delightful. The
constitution of his body was healthful ond strong: old age, which to
others is of itself a disease‚ wrought in him no alteration either of '
mind or body3 for being eighty-three years old, his judgment in
the weightiest matters of state was observed to he as quick, and
his memory as ripe, as when he was in the middle of his youth.

‘⁶ That which is supposed to have hastened his death, was the
unfortunate death of the Kiug at Flowden; for after the report of
that loss, he was never perceived to laugh‚ nor willingly did he
hear anything that sounded unto mirth or gladness3 and, there·
upon, had resolved to live the rest of his time obscure and retirsd3
yet being called hythe council to assist some great business which
for the time was in hand, he sickenedin his, journey towards Edin·
burgh, and the sixth day after his coming thither, died most
Christianly. His body embalmed, was carried afterwards to Aber-
dene‚ and entombed in his own college before the high altar.'’

It may be permitted further to relieve the tediousness of these

chronological notes by the character of Elphinstone, drawn by the

pen of Bishop Leslie.
