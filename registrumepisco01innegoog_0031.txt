THE PREFAOE. xxiii

of Marsy, regarding their respective diocesan rights in the churches
of Auchendor and Invereullen.¹ Boece records his recovering
from the wicked Highlanders-improbos quosdam montiaco-the
woodlands of Birss and Clova. He died in the year 1939.2 „

’ He was succeeded by Ralph de hambley, previously Abbotof Ar·
broath, cio· mopooe honestatis, says Fordun.³ Boece says he was
chosen for merit—tantum cc tenpestate desiderium (qood nodis cidere
minime cst concessum) postoris qui optamus asset habendi, mortalium
cninros incesserat-and relates that he carried with him the asceti-
cism of the convent into the Episcopal palace, and even made his
visitatione of his diocese on foot. It is curicus to find, even in the
days of Boece‚ such a distinction drawn between Episcopsl luxury
and the discipline and manners of the LordAbbot of the great
mitred abbey of Arbroath. In 1240, August 20, Bishop Ralph
granted the common churches of the chapter an exemption from
procurations and other Episcopo] dues.⁴ On the sad October, of
the same year, he was at St. Andrews.⁶ In 1242 he affixed his
seal to a composition between the Prior of St. Andrews and the
Earl of Mar, regarding the churches of Tarland and Migvy ;6 and
the same year obtained a royal grant of free forestry in Birss and
Fettimeir! At the desire of Sir William Byset, and to free him¹
of suspicion of guilt he exeommuniccted those who had partaken
of the murder of the Earl of Athol at Hadington in lats.
