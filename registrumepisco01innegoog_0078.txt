This volume, the property of King's Collega, and inscribed on
the back, “ Registrum Ceth. Eccles. Abordonensis,” appears, from
an entry in Β., compared with oue in this Register,⁹ to have been
the “ Registmm Rubeum³ of the cathedral scribes. It consiste
of 84 leaves of parchment, ofa small, folio sine, and bas been writ-
ten by different hands, and probably, at one time, formed different
fasciculi.

The first portion, consisting of inventories of books, jewels, and
charters iu the treasury, is distinct, aud apparently written in 1436.
Ι1 is followed bya series of statutos, the latest date of which is
1461. Altera single charter of Jamas III. 1469, follows another
series of statutes of the church of Aberdecn, various bulls, anda
few charters of the time of David II. aud Robcrt ΙΙ. This portion,
which appears to be the most ancient of the volume, may be as·
eribed to the middle and latter part of the fourteenth century.

The remaining part of the volume is in several different hauds;
part of it of the middle of the fifteanth century, but the documents
at 1114 end written as lateas 1114 sixteentlr century.
