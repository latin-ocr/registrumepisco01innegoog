xxxiv THE PREFACE.

No more convenient opportunity may oller of explaining the

nature ol those “ Second Tithoe? which formed the frultbtl sub-
* ject ol dispute between the bishops of Aberdeen and the men ol
their diocese, for centuries. Without founding on the question·'
,able charters of David and Mulcolm, the right of the bishops of
