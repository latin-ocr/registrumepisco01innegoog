in the Ohurch Registers, ’ have no immediate reference to the pro·

perty of the Chapter, or the constitution of the Cathedral. The
oldest and most interesting of these are the charters of the Tem-

Mary-oultir‚ on the banks of 'the Dee. 'Phe settlement between
the Bishop of St. Andrews and the Culdees of Monymuslc which

constitution of those old Columbites, and incidentally evidences
some ancient Cburch dues, the nature oi which, and the very

Templars‚ with their opposite neighbours, the Monks of Kelso, for
the emancipation of their chapel at Mary-cultir, which encroached
on the rights of the parish church of Cultir, the property of Koloe,
is particularly important for the history of the district.⁸ ⁴Among
the other charters of this sectiou will be noticed foundations of
hospitals at Kincardine Ouele by Alan Durward‚ and at New-
burgh in Buohan by Alexander Comyn Earl of Buchan, in the
middle of the thirteenth century3 a foundation for the support oi
the causcway through the Cowie Month ;³ and the charter of elec·

two last documenta, the letter of bailiary‚ which, although not

about 1549 3⁸ and the foundations of a Mass and Anniversariea ior
the soul of Bishop Elphinston,⁶ are placed here, from having been
omitted in their proper order. Ι M
