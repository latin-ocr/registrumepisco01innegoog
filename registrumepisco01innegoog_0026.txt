01 whom he speaks, notwithstanding his mistaken patronymic,
when he mentions David Ι. as his son, and Malcolm IV. as his
great-grandson, aud bestows upon him his well-known appella·

According, then, to this,¹ the oldest authority for the tradition,
and entitled to the more weight that it was written within the
walls 01 the cathedral, a bishop’s See was founded atMcrthlaeh
in 1063, which corresponds with the sixth year of the reign 01
Malcolm Canmor.

Another record, not, indeed, of so high antiquity or authority,
asserta the translation 01 the See 01 Morthlach to Aberdeen, to
have taken place in 1115.2

It is hardly necessary to obserre, that these dates are more con-
sistent with the number 01 bishops between the foundation of the
See and its translation to Aberdeen, as preserved by the unvarying

ded, tradition 01 the Church, than the period assigned by Fordun and
Boece, which would extend the incumbency 01 three bishops over
a period 0100 less than 112 years.
