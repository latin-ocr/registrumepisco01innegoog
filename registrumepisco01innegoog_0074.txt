lxvi THE PREFACE.

iu 1577, but hc does not state his authority. Bishop William

Gordon died on the 6th August 1577. Spotiswood’s character of

ε ’ him is short and plain. “This man, brought up in letters at
Aberdceu, followed his studies a long time in Paris, 'and returning
once, was first parson of Olet, and afterwards promovcd to the
θίν’ ⁶ See. Some hopes he gave at first of a virtuous man, but after-

2 ι fga„ warda turned averyepicure, spending all his time in drinking and

mats,
“w ιι

Wolff& senseat converting the victual·duties in money, agreat part whereof he
. βία Wffaewasted upon his base children, and the whores, their mothers;
””’” ’ aman not worthy to be placed in this cataloguc.”¹
“ In his timc‚” says Father Hay, “ the glorious structure of the
cathedrale, which had been near uiue score of years in building,
was defaced by a crsw of sacrilegious church robers; for in 1560
the barons of Mernes, accompauied with some of the townsmen of
Aberdcen, having demolished the Monasteries of the Black and
Gray Friars, fell to rob the Cathcdrale, which they spoiled of all
its costly ornaments and jewels,anddemolishedthechanoa113 they
shipped the lead, bells, and other utensils‚ intending to exposa
them to sale in Holland; but all this ill-gotten wenlth sunk by
the just judgment of God, not fur from the Girdleness. The body
of the Cathedral was preserved from utter ruine hythe Earle of
Huntly, and, in 1607, repaired and covered with slate at the charge
of the parish, and so continues yet in pretty good order.''
